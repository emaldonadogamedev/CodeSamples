You should not have to worry much about using premake. Simply run build.bat to
generate a Visual Studio solution. You can build and run the project from within
Visual Studio. Before submitting, run clean.bat to cleanup any build artifacts.
Please do not include the premake folder when you are creating your Zip file to
submit on Moodle; it is not necessary. If you changed your premake script for
whatever reason, feel free to then include the Lua file, but not the rest of
Premake. Please leave a remark in your README.txt explaining what you changed
and why. Also, please do not include the sample folder when creating your
archive.
